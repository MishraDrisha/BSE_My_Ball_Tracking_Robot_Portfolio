# Ball Tracking Robot

Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

My final milestone was to finish up my project and add in a modification. I put all of my code into one file and added code to allow the robot to move based on where the ball was. For my modification, I added 2 LED lights. The green light turns on when the ball is detected and the red light turns on when the ball is not detected. My two main accomplishments during BlueStamp were understanding new code, and completing the project by myself with minimal help. 2 challenges I faced were meeting deadlines for the project, and making my final file of code work fully. The main things that I learned in the course of making this project are some basics of Raspberry Pi, Python, and building circuits. I was also able to improve my ability to communicate with others.  
In the end, my project is able to track a ball using image processing and is able to move towards it using motors and ultrasonic sensors. In the future after BlueStamp, I hope to make more modifications to this project and make more robots similar to this one.  


# Second Milestone

I have accomplished a lot since my last milestone. My last milestone was getting the robotâ€™s motors to operate properly. Since then, I have also been able to program the ultrasonic sensors to detect how far an object is in front of it. When the project is complete, the sensors will be used to detect how far away the ball is and the motors will move the robot closer to the ball. My second milestone is being able to do image processing on an image taken by the Pi Camera. The main issue I faced during this milestone was because my Pi Camera stopped working. I had to complete all my code without having a camera to test it with immediately. When the new camera came, the code worked properly. This project surprised me because the code is a lot simpler than expected. My next step is to put all my code together, finish up my project, and add in a modification.

The main parts of my project are the Raspberry Pi, the Pi camera, the motors, and the ultrasonic sensors. All of these components will be connected to the robot car chassis. The Raspberry Pi will be controlling the robot. So far, I have been able to assemble the car chassis, take images and videos from the Pi camera, and run the motors. I faced challenges when connecting the h bridge, the motors, and the Raspberry Pi. I solved this problem by researching on my own and found helpful websites to connect the components. I would like to connect my ultrasonic sensors and do image processing next.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
